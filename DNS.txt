DNS(Domain name system)

1.DNS is a host name to ip address Translation service
2.It is an Application Layer Protocol 
3.Previously All the host name were saved in host txt file
4. 6 Top level domains included .com,.org,.mil,.net,.edu
5.forward and resverse DNS lookups
6.Highly Targated for Hacking Purpose
7.It uses TCP port 53 and UDP port 53
8.Today , DNS support 13 Root Name server (https://root-servers.org/)  Named by alphabetically

Note: In maximum cases we uses UDP protocol, It is connection less protocol thats why it is fast
      BUT when we Require acknowledgement then we use TCP protocol less chances of data loss 

               Domain
	1)Generic  2)Country  3) Inverse
 eg..net,.edu       eg. .uk,.us,.in      eg. IP to dommain name mapping

              Namespace
	1)Flat     2)Hieracrchical
eg. In this method,Name os assigned to an address it is in sequence of chracter without any structure.
eg. In this Name is made of Several Paths, Name space cant be Decentralised. 

Hierachy of Name server
-root server
-Top level Server
- Authoritative Server

Host --> Request to Resolve -->Name server --> Root Server -->Name server --> Name Server

In Iteratice they are not interconnected.
while in Recursive root server connected till end.(Interconnected)


Fully Qualified domain name(FQN) 

In this a label is terminated by nuLL string
eg. XYZ.google.co.in
It contains Full Name of host

Partially qualified domain name(PQN)

In this a label is not terminated by  null string
eg. XYZ.google.co.in
PQDN Start from node but does not reach till root


	  Root 
	 /
	.in,.uk,.com
