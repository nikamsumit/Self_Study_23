EBS

EBS its block level storage service provided by aws used for indivisual storage.

it is not used for more than one instance. it provides high performance option for many use cases.

EBS stores files in multiple volumes called blocks , which act as seprate hard drives and storage is not accessible via innternet


EBS is similar to a hard-drive connected to a physical computer and this storage can be attached and detached at any time.


EFS

EFS is a file-level storage service that basically provides a shared elastic file system with virtually unlimited scalability support

EFS is highly available storage that can be utilized by many servers at the same time

scalability feature of EFS also provides cost benefits as you need not pay anything for the part of storage that you donâ€™t use, you only pay for what you use

IOPS rate in EFS is inversely proportional to the size of data. (One most important feature of EFS that makes it different)

if the size of data is less, then the performance and IOPS rate might be not much significant but when used more heavily, EFS can offer as much as 10 GB/sec along with 500,000 IOPS.
